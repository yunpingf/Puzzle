## SpiroPuzzle
This is a dynamically-changing puzzle game as a Chrome Desktop APP based on HTML5 Canvas. The pattern of the puzzle keeps changing while the player is playing, but the position of each piece doesn't change. So while the pattern is changing, the player can make some progress. The dynamically-chaning pattern makes the game more interesting.

HTML5 Canvas is very powerful, developers can produce beautiful patterns using HTML5 Canvas just by writing lines of codes. Since this project is experimental, I use Canvas to produce Spirographs. Spirographs consist of symmetric arcs. These simple arcs leave fewer clues to players, as a result, making the game more challenging.
